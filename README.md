## Usage

### Installation

- From *binary*: go to the [release page](https://github.com/Swatto/td/releases)
- From *source*: `go get github.com/Swatto/td`

### Information

*td* will look at a `.todos` files to store your todos (like Git does: it will try recursively in each parent folder). This permit to have different list of todos per folder.

If it doesn't find a `.todos`, *td* use an environment variable to store your todos: `TODO_DB_PATH` where you define the path to the JSON file. If the file doesn't exist, the program will create it for you.
